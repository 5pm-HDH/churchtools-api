## Upgrade Guide - Upgrading from v1 to v2

For version 2 we refactor the complete code base to provide a better overview and split the code in the diffrent churchtools parts (groups, events, calendars, bookings). To migrate your from version 1 to 2 please check out this upgrade guide:

### High Impact Changes:

**Reorganizce Coadebase and refactor imports ([PR173](https://github.com/5pm-HDH/churchtools-api/pull/173), [PR165](https://github.com/5pm-HDH/churchtools-api/pull/165))**

Please update the imports in your code for each Request and Model. You can make use of your IDE's intellisense or refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/5pm-HDH/churchtools-api#requests-and-models) to find the correct namespaces.

**Upgrade PHP Version to 8.1 and dump support for 8.0 ([PR171](https://github.com/5pm-HDH/churchtools-api/pull/171))**

With security support for PHP 8.0 set to expire on November 26, the focus will shift away from 8.0 in favor of embracing new language features in PHP 8.1. You can find more information about supported PHP versions at https://www.php.net/supported-versions.php.

Update your PHP Version on your system and reinstall the composer dependencies.

### Medium Impact Changes:

**Changed Authentication of CT-Client ([PR142](https://github.com/5pm-HDH/churchtools-api/pull/142))**

The authentication method for the churchtools API has been updated. Previously, the API-token was included in every request. Now, authentication will be based on the provided cookie session, which will significantly improve request speed. To be up to date with the authentication methods please check out the [documentation](https://github.com/5pm-HDH/churchtools-api/blob/master/docs/out/CTConfig.md#2-authentication). As a result of this change, the Config API has also been modified:

- `CTConfig::validateApiKey()` is replaced with `CTConfig::validateAuthentication()`
- `CTConfig::authWithLoginToken($userId, $loginToken)` now only needs loginToken as parameter, because userId is not required: `CTConfig::authWithLoginToken($loginToken)`.
- `AuthRequest::retrieveApiToken()` now needs the userId as parameter.

### Low Impact Changes:

**Upgrade Monolog to v3 ([PR171](https://github.com/5pm-HDH/churchtools-api/pull/171))**

We upgraded monolog to v3 to be compatible with Laravel 10. There is now action required.

**Ugrade Guzzle from 7.4 to 7.7 ([PR154](https://github.com/5pm-HDH/churchtools-api/pull/154))**

No action required.
