# Documentation

The documentation in the docs/out directory is generated by running the DocGenerator script. To execute the
DocGenerator, run the following composer command:

```
composer run-script docs-generator
```

If you make changes to the docs (docs/src/resources), be sure to run the DocGenerator and commit the generated output
files.

The Generator will take the template-docs (docs/src/ressources) and transform the code samples to real code for the
documentation. There are two types of code samples:

1. Templates to include Unit-Test (see [Template-Snippets](#template-snippets))
2. Code examples that are executed (see [PHP-Snippets](#php-snippets-deprecated))

## Template-Snippets

With the template-snippets, code from unit-tests can be included. This has the main advantage that this code also
extends and improves the unit-test suite. The Github CI executes these unit-tests and ensures that they are working
code. To include a unit-test code-sample, use this template syntax:

```
{{ \Tests\Unit\Docs\EventRequestTest.testEventRequestDocExample }}
```

The Doc-Generator takes the unit-test code and transforms the assertEquals statements to more readable code. All
Unit-Test for the documentation are stored in the directory tests/unit/docs/. For example, the already mentioned
unit-test testEventRequestDocExample has this assert-statement:

```php
$this->assertEquals(21, $christmasService->getId());
```

This is transformed by the doc-generator to a more readable code:

```php
var_dump( $christmasService->getId());
// Output: 21
```

- ⚠ Only use `assertEquals` statements as other assertions won't be transformed.
- ⚠ Do not use assert statements inside a loop or if/switch statement.
- ⚠ Only use simple values like string, integer, and boolean as assert parameters, not objects or arrays.

## PHP-Snippets (Deprecated)

⚠ It is not recommended to use PHP-Snippets for new documentation because they are not included in the unit-test suite
and are therefore not tested by the CI-Pipeline.

PHP-Snippets are used in docs/src/ressources/CTConfig.md. The code examples are executed by the doc-generator and the
content of variables can be displayed to the user using the dd function.

This example Code-Snippet...

```php 
$a = 2 + 2;
dd($a);
```

...will be transfered to this Doc:

```php
$a = 2 + 2;
echo ($a);
// OUTPUT: 4
```

The Doc-Generator replaces the "dd" function call with an "echo" call to display the content of a variable. ⚠ However,
it is not permitted to use the dd(...) method in any kind of loop or if/switch-statement.

## Execution Enviroment

The Generator-Script creates the CTClientMock environment which redirects all HTTP calls to the JSON files located in
the tests/unit/HttpMock/data directory.

## Github-Action

The GitHub Action for the doc-generator runs the DocGenerator and checks for any uncommitted changes. If there are any,
the Action will fail. To resolve this, run the DocGenerator locally and commit all the generated doc files.
