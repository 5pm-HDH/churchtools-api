# Documentation

The Documentation in the `docs`-Directory are generated by the DocGenerator-Script. The DocGenerator can be executed by composer:

```
composer run-script docs-generator
```

The Generator will then execute every PHP-Code example to ensure that they are executable! The Template-Docs are stored in the `docs/src/ressources`-Directory.


## Template-Docs

The Doc-Templates are MD-Files contain all the information the Doc should contain. Only the PHP-Code examples are processed by the DocGenerator-Script. This Script executes the Code-Examples and display the result in the generated Doc.

This example Code-Snippet...

```php 
$a = 2 + 2;
dd($a);
```

...will be transfered to this Doc:

```php
$a = 2 + 2;
echo ($a);
// OUTPUT: 4
```

The Generator converts the "dd"-Function call to an "echo" call. In the next Line it will display the content of the variable $a.

⚠ The `dd(...)`-Method is not allowed in any kind of Loop or If/Switch-Statement.⚠

## Execution Enviroment
The Generator-Script builds the CTClientMock-Enviroment. All Http calls are redirected to the Json-Files in the `tests/unit/HttpMock/data`-directory.

## Github-Action

If you change something in the template-docs please call the generator-script. The Github-Action "doc-generator" will check if there is any inconsistency between the template-docs and the generated docs.
